Got it — here’s the narrative of how the JavaScript came together, step by step:

---

### The Beginning: autoplay muted video

You started simple: you asked how to get **one vertical video** to autoplay muted in the browser and on iOS. The goal was to prove that inline playback would work on GitHub Pages. We wrote a tiny HTML file with `<video playsinline muted autoplay>` and confirmed it played muted, inline, with controls. That gave you confidence the core idea (Reels-style playback) was possible.

---

### Next Step: scrolling between videos

From there, you wanted to swipe between multiple clips. We added **CSS scroll-snap** so each video fills the viewport, one per “page,” and then layered in **IntersectionObserver** to detect which video is active. The behavior:

-   When a video is ≥75% visible, it plays.
-   All other videos pause.
-   The next video preloads lightly so it feels seamless.

At this stage, you had a vertical feed where swiping worked and only the active video played.

### Refinement: mute toggle

You noticed the native controls let you tap to unmute, but you wanted a custom **mute/unmute button**. At first, we wired mute per-video, meaning each button only affected its own video. That worked, but you caught the difference from Instagram: on Reels, mute is a **global state.**

---

### Evolving toward platform-like behavior

You asked for looping, and realized mute needed to apply everywhere. We adjusted:

-   Every video now loops (`v.loop = true`).
-   **Global mute/unmute**: one state stored in `localStorage`, applied to all videos. Toggle once, and every video follows that preference.
-   Buttons across all reels sync to show the correct state (🔇 or 🔊).
-   The active video replays immediately when the mute state changes (this primes iOS to allow sound after a user gesture).

---

### Result: authentic Reels-style functionality

By the end, you had:

-   A vertical, scroll-snapping feed of videos.
-   Only the visible video plays, others pause.
-   All videos loop automatically.
-   One global mute/unmute state that persists across swipes and reloads.
-   Keyboard controls for desktop (↑/↓ scroll, space/K play/pause, M mute).
-   Pause on tab hidden, resume on focus.

---

👉 In short: you started with _“I just need autoplay muted video to work”_ and evolved toward _“I want this to behave like Instagram Reels.”_ Each step was guided by what you observed: first autoplay, then scrolling, then looping, and finally the global mute behavior.

Would you like me to distill this down into a **2–3 sentence version** you could say out loud on stream, so your viewers get the story arc without the whole play-by-play?
